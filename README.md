# CPE-400-Final-Project-Spring-2022
Dynamic Fault Routing

Names: Blong Vang, Clint Vega

# Usage: 
To run the program simulation, from the command line, use:
> python3 faulty_routing.py

then enter the number of simulations to run desired. A number greater than 5000 is recommended for an accurate analysis to be performed. Otherwise, enter the number '1' to simulate a single instance with randomized failure.

Generate a new Graph file to test a new set of nodes and edges and fail rates against using the following command:
> python3 generate_files.py

# Dependencies:
> sudo apt install -y libgl1

> pip3 install networkx 

> pip3 install matplotlib
